        <h2>Importance of MathML</h2>
        <p>MathML is important because there is no way of eoncoding Math in HTML. It provides a consistent way of providing mathematical content on the web.
        This makes sure mathematical notations and formulas are accessible and formated properly across different platforms. MathML also works well with other web technologies.</p>

        <p>MathML being used in web technologies is an important step forward. In today's world, we want information to move easily between different applications.
        MathML makes it easier for us to do this and to work with mathematical concepts on diffrent platforms.
        It allows us to edit, access and share them.</p>

        <p>Like i said a little bit previously, MathML is also important for accessibility. Not only does it work with screen redears for users with visual impairments.
        It ensures math works well with search engines, e-learning platforms and online platforms. This makes MathML very important for the future of math in science and education.</p>
