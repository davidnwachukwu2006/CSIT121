        <h2>What is MathML?</h2>
        <p>MathML is a standard created by the World Wide Web Consrtium. It was created so that we would be able to use mathematical notations and concepts on the web. 
        MathML is the international standard for writing mathematical content on the web, the same that HTML is the international standard for web text.
        By Using MathML, we ensure that documents containing mathematical content are accessible.</p>
        
        <p>MathML is made up by multiple XML tags that allow users to edit the information as they please. Before it was created, web authors used images 
        instead to display mathematical content. This became a problem because not every image could be accessed. Atlough web authors could use alt tags to
        describe the equation, this does not compare to actually seeing the equation by yourself.</p>

        <p>MathML is used for more than just visual representation, it also makes mathematical content easier to work with assistive devices like screen readers.
        This allows individuals with visual impairments to access equations and formulas. Integrating MathML into web content allows developers to create 
        inclusive experiences that close the gap between accessibility and sophisticated mathematics.</p>
