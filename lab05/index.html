                <p class="highlight">When I first picked the class, I had no idea that we would be actually coding. <br> I thought we would just be 
                learning the theory behind websites. But here we are. Obviosly this all new to me, but breaking it down has
                made the introduction much easier to understand.</p>

                <p class="highlight">Onto my second week coding HTML. Still is not that bad just yet lol. This week <br> we focused on creating styles 
                for our code through CSS. It hasn't been that challenging trying to understand except for when we first went through
                the structure, I was unsure of where to put my style tags and the syntax behind it. But i think I've got the hang of it!</p>

                <p class="highlight">This week we focused on layouts. How different types of layouts would appear on different devices. 
                We also covered how to layout content differently using flex or grid based on the device we are displaying the website on.</p>
