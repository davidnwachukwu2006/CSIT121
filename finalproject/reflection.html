            <h2>This Assignment</h2>
            <p>When I first read what I would be doing for this final project, I immediately knew this would be fun and exciting. This project as a whole gave me a bit of a nostalgic feeling.
            Seeing how far I have come this semester and being able to put everything I have learnt over the cource of 14 weeks into one final project. I'm really grateful for the experience.

            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>I tested my website on my final and the layout still looks clean and visually appealing. I tested my web site on Safari and Chrome. The website looked and acted the same on both browsers.</p>

        <h2>Course Reflection</h2>
        <p>I came into this course with 0 knowledge of HTML or even what that was. With that being said, I was excited about learning what HTML has to over and how it is used. 
        I'm delighted that I have seen myself learn and grow from the first week of the semester, I am know able to create a simple website, style it, and add interactivity as well. 
        I really enjoyed this class, I liked how our professor was passionate about what she was teaching which made me even more interested in learning the content. Thank you for being so passionate about your work.</p>
